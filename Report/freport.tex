{\fontsize{25pt}{25pt}
Computed medical record database management is increasingly important as information and computer technology progress rapidly. Medical records contain treatment history and relevant experiences pertaining to the patients need to be documented accurately and efficiently. In many parts of the world clinical documentations are still being handwritten on forms and filed into paper medical
records. The shortcomings of paper records are well identified,for example, illegibility and poorly organized records may lead to information gaps or inconsistencies, when used by another or even the same user later on. Hardcopies of documents are slow to be transferred around, with higher risk of being misplaced. In
addition, when handled by multi-users in multi-locations, the quality of safekeeping can be significantly affected. The advent of computer technology has introduced enormous possibilities for electronic documentation and usage of electronic medical records.A computerized database management system is designed and implemented to replace the existing traditional hand recorded system in a veterinary polyclinic.The system provides easy access to patient registration,diagnosis,appointment and report generation.The new system has higher efficiency in terms of time taken,cost and data security protection as compared to the traditional hand recorded system.}

In many parts of the world clinical documentations are still being handwritten on forms and filed into paper medical records. The shortcomings of paper records are well identified,for example, illegibility and poorly organized records may lead to information gaps or inconsistencies, when used by another or even the same user later on. Hardcopies of documents are slow to be transferred around, with higher risk of being misplaced. In addition, when handled by multi-users in multi-locations, the quality of safekeeping can be significantly affected. The advent of computer technology has introduced enormous possibilities for electronic documentation and usage of electronic medical records.A computerized database management system is designed and implemented to replace the existing traditional hand recorded system in a veterinary polyclinic.The system provides easy access to patient registration,diagnosis,appointment and report generation.It can also collect,calculate and plot statistical data.The new system has higher efficiency in terms of time taken,cost and data security protection as compared to the traditional hand recorded system.

\chapter{Detailed Design Document using Appendix A and B}
 \section{Introduction}  
In veterinary polyclinics, the hospital records are managed manually. The records are hand-
written and the reports are made by the doctors.We have proposed a system that will automate
these manual tasks. Since it is a web application, the doctors can access it remotely.The
application coordinates the activities of different branches of the hospital and communicates
between them.This will ease the processes of hospital management. Since the system is
providing statistics and reports of the hospital records, much of the work will be reduced.

\chapter{Project Implementation}
  \section{Introduction}
  We have implemented this project using various tools and technology like HTML, CSS for client side scripting, PHP for server side scripting, Apache 2 server that works on the central system and MySQL database.
  \section{Tools and Technologies Used}
  \begin{enumerate}[1.]
 \item HTML:
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages. A web form or HTML form on a web page allows a user to enter data that is sent to a server for processing. Forms can resemble paper or database forms because web users ﬁll out the forms using checkboxes, radio buttons, or text ﬁelds. Used for writing forms which form the basis of data storing from the user.
\item CSS:
A CSS framework is a pre-prepared software framework that is meant to allow for easier, more standards-compliant web design using the Cascading Style Sheets language. Most of these frameworks contain at least a grid. More functional frameworks also come with more features and additional JavaScript based functions, but are mostly design oriented and unobtrusive. This diﬀerentiates these from functional and full JavaScript frameworks. Used for styling of the User Interface.
\item PHP: 
Hypertext Preprocessor (or simply PHP) is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server combines the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be any type of data, including images, with the generated web page. Used for back end for connectivity and transactions.
\item MySQL:
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). MySQL is a central component of the LAMP open-source web application software stack (and other "AMP" stacks). LAMP is an acronym for "Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python". MySQL is also used in many high-profile, large-scale websites, including Google (though not for searches), Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube. Used for storing the main data for the system.

\chapter{Software Testing}
 \section{Type of Testing Used}
   There are diﬀerent types of testing we use in our project. Some testing types are as follows:
   \begin{enumerate}[1.]
  \item	UNIT TESTING: 
Unit testing is the testing in which we do an individual unit or group of related units. It falls under the class of white box testing. It is often done by the programmer to test that the unit she has implemented is producing expected output against given input. So here we do the individual function testing.

\item	INTEGRATION TESTING: 
Integration testing is testing in which a group of components are combined to produce output. Also, the interaction between software and hardware is tested in integration testing if software and hardware components have any relation. It may fall under both white box testing and black box testing.

\item	FUNCTIONAL TESTING: 
Functional testing is the testing to ensure that the speciﬁed functionality required in the system requirements works. It falls under the class of black box testing.

\item	SYSTEM SYSTEMS: 
System testing is the testing to ensure that by putting the software in diﬀerent environments (e.g., Operating Systems) it still works. System testing is done with full system implementation and environment. It falls under the class of black box testing.

\item	PERFORMANCE TESTING: 
Performance testing is the testing to assess the speed and eﬀectiveness of the system and to make sure it is generating results within a speciﬁed time as in performance requirements. It falls under the class of black box testing. It checks the performance of our system.

\item	USABILITY TESTING: 
Usability testing is performed to the perspective of the client, to evaluate how the GUI is user-friendly? How easily can the client learn? After learning how to use, how proﬁciently can the client perform? How pleasing is it to use its design? This falls under the class of black box testing.

\item	ACCEPTANCE TESTING: 
Acceptance testing is often done by the customer to ensure that the delivered product meets the requirements and works as the customer expected. It falls under the class of black box testing.
   \end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item CONCLUSION :\\ \\
Thus,the digital system gets implemented and the traditional hand written system gets atomised.Separate user interfaces for doctors and administrator is created to simplify the work.The project also considers the Inventory management aspect of the veterinary polyclinic.A systematic approach is followed for the process starting from insemination stage ,infertility,pregnancy diagnosis and finally the calf birth.The reports get generated as per the users requirements which reduce a lot of work for the doctors.An automated messaging system is implemented which helps in notifying the patients about their next infertility check up which is due in 3 months.Hence,this way our project becomes the first web application for a veterinary polyclinic in Maharashtra.Hence,this is our small contribution to the Digital India campaign.\\ \\
\item FUTURE SCOPE :
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item A mobile application can be developed for the same.
\item Medical Inventory can be added as a part of clinical dbms.
\item The patients can make appointments using the system will be a part of future development.

Application for managing veterinary polyclinic

\begin{enumerate}
\item Aim: Project problem statement feasibility assessment using NP-Hard, NP-Complete or satisfiability issues using modern algebra.
\item NP class : A problem is assigned to the NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) class if it is solvable in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine. A P-problem (whose solution time is bounded by a polynomial) is always also NP.
\item NP-Complete Class: In computational complexity theory, an NP-complete decision problem is one which is in the NP complexity class and which is also NP-hard. In this context, NP stands for "nondeterministic polynomial time". The set of NP-complete problems is often denoted by NP-C or NPC.
\item NP Hard Class: The complexity class of decision problems that are intrinsically harder than those that can be solved by a nondeterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. P Class: It contains all decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine using a polynomial amount of computation time, or polynomial time.
\item Complexity of query processing

In practice, we deal with the data complexity of the Query Evaluation Problem for Relational Calculus,
because we typically have a small fixed collection of queries to answer (while the database instances vary).
The complexity of query evaluation problem depends uopn two factors- the query complexity and the data complexity. The combined complexity is given as NP-complete.
\item Client-server application

the proposed system is a 3-tier application.
It involves client server communication. The communication problems are reduced to NP-complete problems using Graph theory.

Thus the overall system complexity becomes NP complete.

\item Adding patient details
When a patient arrives at the doctor, the doctor accesses his basic details from the database.
He diagnoses the animal and treats him or provides treatment details. Doctor’s module is not a heavy one since he has to focus more on treatment of the patient.
